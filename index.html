    <b>About Me:</b>
    <p>
        Hello, my name is Talal Fakhoury, and I am 19 years old. I am currently studying Finance and Data Science at Northeastern University. Born and raised in Jordan, I cherish the vibrant culture and close-knit community of my hometown. I completed high school at King’s Academy, where I was the leader of the Environment & Sustainability Club and actively engaged in varsity soccer, even serving as captain of the Varsity B team.
        </p>

        <p>
            At Northeastern, I am an active member of the Finance Investment Club, where I’ve gained insights into investment banking, private equity, and asset management through workshops and networking with industry professionals. I am also passionate about sustainability, a commitment I carried from high school, where I organized successful environmental campaigns and events.
        </p>

        <p>
            Outside of academics, I have a variety of interests including football, wrestling, chess, and gaming. These activities not only keep me balanced but also offer opportunities for personal growth and strategic thinking. Looking to the future, I hope to apply my analytical skills and financial knowledge to make meaningful contributions to the field.
